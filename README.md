# Classifying songs by genre

This repository is a synthesis of the existing research in songs lyrics classification. More details of the experiments can be found in the [official report](official_report.pdf) that we have compiled.

For easier experimentation, the experiments are compiled in Jupyter notebooks, and the preprocessing steps are implemented as python scripts, so they can be easily reused in preprocessing pipelines.
